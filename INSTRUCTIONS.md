## Technical notes

For CSS, I decided to use the CSS-in-JS solution that comes with Material UI; The main reason why I chose to use this is because it is now the [officially recommended way](https://material-ui.com/styles/basics/#why-use-material-uis-styling-solution) to customize Material UI and all the examples were already using it; Also, I have [experience with CSS-in-JS solutions, so I thought this could be a good conversation starter :)
